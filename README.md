Trace: Robust Traceroute Implementation

Project Overview

Welcome to the "Trace" project! This repository houses a highly efficient and robust implementation of the traceroute command, written in pure C. 
With this tool, you can enhance your network diagnostics and troubleshooting capabilities, allowing you to uncover and visualize the hidden pathways of 
your data packets.

About the Project

This "Trace" project is a testament to my learning about network diagnostics and understanding the complex routes that data packets take across the Internet. I built this traceroute implementation from the ground up, using C for its performance and efficiency.
Key Features

    Pure C Implementation: This traceroute implementation is coded in pure C, making it fast, lightweight, and highly efficient.

    Robust Tracing: "Trace" offers robust tracing capabilities, helping you uncover the exact path your data packets take, including intermediate hops and response times.

    Network Troubleshooting: Use "Trace" to identify network bottlenecks, latency issues, and unexpected routing, which is invaluable for troubleshooting network problems.

    Enhanced Visualization: The results provided by "Trace" are not just informative but also visually intuitive, allowing you to see the journey your data packets make on their way to their destination.

Why This Matters

Network diagnostics are a crucial aspect of maintaining and optimizing network performance. 
By offering a powerful and efficient traceroute implementation, we empower network administrators, engineers, and enthusiasts to gain deeper insights 
into their network's behavior.
